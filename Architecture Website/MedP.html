	<p align = "justify" class = "pj"><font size = "4">The medieval period in Bosnia lasted until the invasion of Ottoman Empire. The continuing links between these related clusters stimulated both trade and economy. Individual families lived together in houses known as Dinaric houses.
	<br><br>These were simple structures build of natural materials (usually timber and wickerwork). Interior space was organized around the hearth in a central room with separate private quarters for men and women. Even though military fortresses in Bosnia and Herzegovina date from Roman times, most of them were built between the 12th and 15th century.
	<br><br> The structures were built out of ruff cut stone on hills overlooking a river, route or town. Today there are around 300 of them but most of them are in ruins. The most beautiful and well preserved are: Sarajevo, Srebrenik, Blagaj, Jajce, Travnik, Te≈°anj, Pocitelj, Doboj, Vranduk, Bobovac, Stolac, Maglaj, Gradacac, Ljubuski, Sokol, Sokolac na Uni Dobor, Kljuc, Bihac, Bosanska Krupa, Ostrozac, Ostrovica, Velika Kladusa, Visegrad, Zvornik, etc. The court in Kraljeva Sutjeska was even richly engraved in Gothic style. An example of medieval Gothic and Romanesque tower is the Tower of St. Luke located in Jajce and created in the 15th century.
